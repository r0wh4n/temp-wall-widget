# Summary

This script is a weather app that uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI for the user to enter a city name and get the current weather conditions for that city. The weather data is obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API using the requests library. The script then displays the weather condition, temperature, minimum and maximum temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset in a label on the GUI.

Additionally, it also changes the wallpaper of the desktop based on the current weather condition. It does this by calling the gsettings command to change the desktop background picture URI to the corresponding wallpaper file path. The script supports several different weather conditions such as "Clear", "Clouds", "Snow", "Rain", "Sunny", "Haze", "Smoke" and "Mist".
